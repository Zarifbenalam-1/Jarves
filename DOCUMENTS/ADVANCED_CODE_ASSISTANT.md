```python
def function_name():
    """
    Brief description of function_name
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    pass
```

### 6. Code Improvement Suggestions

#### Usage
```bash
suggest improvements
```

#### Improvement Categories

### 7. Pattern Detection

#### Usage
```bash
detect patterns
```

#### Detected Patterns

**Design Patterns:**
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Generator patterns
- Context Manager patterns
- Decorator patterns

**Anti-Patterns:**
- Arrow anti-pattern (deep nesting)
- Global variable abuse
- Code duplication

### 8. Multi-Language Support

#### Supported Languages
- **Python**: Full analysis with Python-specific checks
- **JavaScript**: Comprehensive JS analysis
- **Java**: Basic analysis with Java-specific patterns
- **C/C++**: Syntax and structure analysis
- **Go**: Basic analysis support

#### Language Detection
The system automatically detects programming languages based on:
- Keywords and syntax patterns
- Import/include statements
- Function definition styles
- Language-specific constructs

## Best Practices Integration

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Full Code Analysis
```bash
ü§ñ JARVIS: analyze code
# Paste your code, type 'END' when finished
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
END

ü§ñ JARVIS: üîç JARVIS Advanced Code Analysis for PYTHON:
