## üé™ DEMO IDEAS TO TEST

1. **"JARVIS, create a Python project called 'AI_Assistant'"** *(voice ‚Üí file creation)*
2. **"Hey JARVIS, switch to sarcastic mode and roast my code"** *(personality + code analysis)*
3. **"JARVIS, start a meeting room and invite my team"** *(multi-user voice room)*
4. **"Computer, what's my schedule and what should I work on?"** *(proactive assistance)*
