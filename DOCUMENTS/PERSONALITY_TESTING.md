   - Rate the difference

3. **Switch to Professional mode** (`personality` â†’ `3`)

- **Humor level**: Varies dramatically between modes
- **Vocabulary**: Genius uses complex terms, Standard is balanced

### If Personality Doesn't Seem to Change:
1. Try a different AI model (Mixtral often shows more personality)
2. Ask more specific questions that highlight personality differences
3. Check that the personality actually switched (look for confirmation message)
4. Some topics may override personality (safety restrictions)
